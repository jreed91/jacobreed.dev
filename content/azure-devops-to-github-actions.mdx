title: 'I Used an AI to Write This Blog Post'

summary: What actually happens when you ask an AI assistant to write for you — a real conversation, unfiltered.
---

I've been putting off writing a blog post about my recent talk. So I did what any reasonable person in 2026 does: I asked my AI to do it.

This is that story.

## The Setup

I run [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai), an open-source AI assistant that lives on my own hardware. It connects to WhatsApp, Telegram, and other messaging apps — so I can just text it like a coworker.

I had a talk coming up on Tuesday about migrating from Azure DevOps to GitHub Actions. I needed a blog post to go with it. I didn't want to write it.

So at 4:53 PM on a Sunday, I texted my AI:

> "Can you help me write a new blog post about my talk on Tuesday. It's about from azure devops to GitHub actions. Using AI to speed up the migration"

## The Back and Forth

The AI didn't just start writing. It asked questions:

- What's the structure?
- Which AI tools did you use?
- Any code examples?
- Who's the audience?
- What tone?

I answered in fragments, the way you do when you're texting:

> "We used copilot that allowed users to create issues in a repository. That issue then prompted GitHub copilot to on board the repo to our shared workflows we created"

> "The shared workflows cover build test deploy. Following a build once deploy many philosophy. Copilot helped onboard in 85% of scenarios. These were widely different azure pipelines."

> "Say 200 repos"

> "Post after Tuesday"

From those scattered messages, it assembled a complete draft. Structure, intro, code blocks, lessons learned section — the whole thing.

## Then I Changed My Mind

The draft was fine. Professional. Informative. Exactly what I asked for.

But something felt off. I was about to publish a post about using AI to do migrations... that I had written using AI. And nobody would know.

So I told it:

> "Can we join the tone of the article to instead talk about how I used you openclaw to write this article. Yes very meta"

It rewrote the intro, added a section about the collaboration, kept the technical content.

Still not quite right.

> "I want it to be entirely about using you to write a blog post. Not about the migration anymore"

And here we are.

## What I Learned

**1. AI writes like you text it**

Short, scattered inputs → serviceable but generic output. 

Detailed context → better results. 

The quality ceiling is set by what you give it.

**2. The first draft is never the post**

I went through three complete pivots in 30 minutes. The AI handled each one without complaint. That's actually its superpower — not the first draft, but the patience for iteration.

**3. Voice is hard**

The AI can match tone if you show it examples. But finding your own voice through an AI is weird. This post only started feeling like *mine* when I decided to write about the process itself.

**4. The real time savings isn't writing — it's starting**

I'd been avoiding this post for days. The friction of opening a blank document and typing a first sentence is real. Texting "hey write me a blog post" has zero friction. 

The AI got me past the blank page. Everything after that was editing.

## The Actual Workflow

Here's what happened, start to finish:

1. **5:01 PM** — I text the AI on Telegram
2. **5:04 PM** — Draft complete, asks for missing details (repo count)
3. **5:08 PM** — "Push it as a PR to my blog"
4. **5:22 PM** — GitHub auth dance (device codes, the usual)
5. **5:27 PM** — First pivot: "make it meta"
6. **5:30 PM** — Second pivot: "forget the migration, make it entirely about this"
7. **5:35 PM** — This version pushed to PR

Total time: 34 minutes from "I should write a post" to PR ready for review.

Total time I spent actually typing content: maybe 2 minutes of text messages.

## Should You Do This?

Depends what you want.

If you want content that sounds like every other AI-generated content, sure, ask an AI to write your posts and publish the first draft.

If you want content that sounds like you, use the AI to get past the blank page, then rewrite until it doesn't feel like AI anymore.

This post is somewhere in between. You can probably tell which parts are mine and which parts are... collaborative.

I'm okay with that.

## The Meta-Meta Observation

I asked an AI to write a post about using AI for migrations.

Then I asked it to write a post about asking it to write a post.

It did both without questioning the recursion.

There's probably a lesson in there about AI and self-awareness, but I'm not going to ask it to write that part.
