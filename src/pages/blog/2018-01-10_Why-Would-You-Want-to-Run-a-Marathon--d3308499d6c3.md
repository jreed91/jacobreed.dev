That’s the question I get asked most often after I say I’m training for a marathon. Why would I want to run 26.2 grueling miles? Is it because I enjoy running that much? Probably not, no runner enjoys running that much. Maybe it’s because I want to get in shape? If I’m going to run 26.2 miles, I better be in good shape before that.

I think the real reason is because I need the challenge. When someone gets to the point where they are ready to run 26.2 miles, they’ve been pushing the boundaries of what their body can do. They want to get out of their comfort zone and see what their limits are. Every time you step outside your comfort zone, you grow stronger and become more confident in yourself. By completing this major milestone I can prove to myself and everyone else that I can accomplish goals if I set my mind to it.

I think that’s the real reason I want to run a marathon, to prove to myself that no matter what you want to accomplish, as long as you set your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.
