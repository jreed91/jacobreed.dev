So you’ve already read our last story:

> [Why Would You Want to Run a Marathon?](https://medium.com/marathon-training-101/why-would-you-want-to-run-a-marathon-d3308499d6c3?)

You’re inspired and ready to run a marathon! Now what should you do? First thing you need is some gear!!

### Running Shoes

#### [Hoka One One Clifton](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MY0HHE5/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01MY0HHE5&linkCode=as2&tag=marathonsite-20&linkId=1556145876a603ded93c2f16c53a62a1)

These are my current shoes of choice. While they look like they would weigh a ton, they really don’t! They have great support and are great for a neutral runner. (More info in another post about finding the perfect shoes).

#### [Saucony Kinvara 7](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018F1H97W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B018F1H97W&linkCode=as2&tag=marathonsite-20&linkId=9f74596f48ec59ca52bcf26fefe59d9d)

Another great choice for neutral runners. Extremely light weight and durable.

### Running Clothes

There are a million options when it comes to running clothes. The main things you want to look for are:

1. Lightweight
2. UV protection
3. Absorbent
4. Comfortable

Here are a few of my favorite items

[Nike Dri-Fit Knit T-Shirt](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00S5L5MJU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00S5L5MJU&linkCode=as2&tag=marathonsite-20&linkId=737b46f35edf82ba3907378da79ae792)

[Under Armor Running Hat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01H8LW93O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01H8LW93O&linkCode=as2&tag=marathonsite-20&linkId=4e026302d40316ea3096484dce78a1f1)

[Nike Running Shorts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M3XFLZ6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01M3XFLZ6&linkCode=as2&tag=marathonsite-20&linkId=18bbbb7f03a7f6f7f0437ffa8bc23b7d)

### Fitness Trackers / Headphones

The last thing you’re going to need is something to track all those miles you will be running. I’m personally a big fan of the Apple Watch just due to the integration with Apple Music. But many runners get one of the Garmin devices. The great thing about these is the great battery life and the stats they will track. You will be able to quickly see the miles you’ve ran, pace, heart rate and dozens of other stats.

If you are the type of runner who likes to listen to music while running, I recommend getting the [Jaybird X3 headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M7NCT5O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01M7NCT5O&linkCode=as2&tag=marathonsite-20&linkId=a947da26e54697c2e09afe4a02d5512e). They are waterproof, have great battery life and sound great too. Look for updates in the electronic area in future posts.

So that is really just a start to the gear you’ll need before you start running.
